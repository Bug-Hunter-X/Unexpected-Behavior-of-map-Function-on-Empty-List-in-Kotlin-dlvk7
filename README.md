This repository demonstrates an uncommon Kotlin code error related to the unexpected behavior of the `map` function when applied to an empty list.  The `map` function, when applied to an empty list, silently returns an empty list. This might be unexpected for developers who anticipate an exception or a different behavior.  The solution showcases an approach to handle such scenarios, demonstrating how to ensure the code's behavior is consistent across different list sizes and preventing potential issues.
